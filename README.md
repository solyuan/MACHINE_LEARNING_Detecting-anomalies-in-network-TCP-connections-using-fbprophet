# Forecasting and detecting anomalies in network TCP connections using fbprophet

This repository includes Python code used for analysis of real, large data of network TCP connections coming from a large company which is used to detect anomalies in the signals' level by the means of time series forecasting.

It makes use of the *fbprophet* library. Fbprophet implements a Generalized Additive Model, and - in a nutshell - models a time-series as the sum of different components (non-linear trend, periodic components and holidays or special events) and allows to incorporate extra-regressors (categorical or continuous). The reference is [Taylor and Letham, 2017](https://peerj.com/preprints/3190.pdf), see also this [manual](https://facebook.github.io/prophet/docs/quick_start.html#python-api) from Facebook research team.

*Source code* folder includes Python code files used for: 
* loading multiple datasets containing information about connections detected over a few weeks time, and creating a summary file with counts of connections per minute. The data loaded is large, hence it was processed chunk by chunk,  
* exploring the time series, its decomposition, building and tunning forecasting model; including seasonal, holiday effects and regressors, 
* creating a framework to detect anomalies using best forecasting model.
